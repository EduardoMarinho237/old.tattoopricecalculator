# üíâ Tattoo Price Calculator

This is a project I created to help with tattoo pricing and standardization for my wife, who works as a tattoo artist ([@AnelizTattoo](https://www.instagram.com/AnelisTattoo)).  
It was built using **React + Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Font Awesome icons**, with some parameters saved in **localStorage**, and it‚Äôs deployed on **Vercel** at  
üëâ [https://tattoopricecalculator.vercel.app](https://tattoopricecalculator.vercel.app)

Currently, she is the only active user of this app in her daily workflow.  
In the future, I plan to improve it and implement additional features.  
Below you‚Äôll find instructions to run it locally.

Quer que eu monte agora uma vers√£o adaptada para o **novo projeto (TattooPriceManager)** com login, clientes, registros e dashboards?  
Posso deixar o README todo profissional e bil√≠ngue (PT/EN) se quiser.
