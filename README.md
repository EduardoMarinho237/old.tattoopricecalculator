# 💉 Tattoo Price Calculator

This is a project I created to help with tattoo pricing and standardization for my wife, who works as a tattoo artist ([@AnelizTattoo](https://www.instagram.com/AnelizTattoo)).  
It was built using **React + Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Font Awesome icons**, with some parameters saved in **localStorage**, and it’s deployed on **Vercel** at  
👉 [https://anelizpricecalculator.vercel.app](https://anelizpricecalculator.vercel.app)

Currently, she is the only active user of this app in her daily workflow.  
In the future, I plan to improve it and implement additional features.  
Below you’ll find instructions to run it locally.

Quer que eu monte agora uma versão adaptada para o **novo projeto (TattooPriceManager)** com login, clientes, registros e dashboards?  
Posso deixar o README todo profissional e bilíngue (PT/EN) se quiser.
